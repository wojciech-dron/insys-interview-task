Below you will find the requirements and a list of tasks left to you, some of them are marked **\***, these are bonus tasks that you do not have to implement, but their implementation will speed up the launch of **InsysGo**.

## How to run

To start the application you will need:
- IDE (i.e. Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code)
